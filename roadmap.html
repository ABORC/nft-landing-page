        <h1>ROADMAP</h1>
        <p>The Agile Bros journey<br>(Might be subject to change)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="roadmap-section-left">
        <p>1 - A community is born<br>February - April</p>
        Agile Bros: Obstacle Racing Club is ultimately about creating a
        welcoming community with one common interest; duking it out on the obstacle course!
        <br>
        <br>
        These are the things we will do to build a foundation for that:
        <br>
        - Create a presence on social media (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/aborc_nft/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ABORC_NFT" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>)
        <br>
        - Create a Discord group for the community (coming soon)
        <br>
        - Create promotional material (images, trailers etc.)
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="roadmap-section-right">
        <p>2 - The first 100 ABORC athletes<br>April - May</p>
        At this point, the first 100 ABORC athletes will be revealed to the world on OpenSea.
        <br>
        A teaser trailer will also be released along with the first batch of athletes, and from this point onwards a
        select number of whitelist spots will be given to members of the community through giveaways and raffles!
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="roadmap-section-left">
        <p>3 - Whitelist minting<br>May</p>
        Before the public minting period, whitelist members will be given the opportunity to snatch their athlete of choice at a reduced price!
        <br>
        Athletes minted during the whitelist minting period will also be given a unique trait along with a slight boost to one random trait!
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="roadmap-section-right">
        <p>4 - The first ABORC live event!<br>June - July</p>
        After the whitelist minting period, public minting will be available!
        <br>
        On july 1st the first ever ABORC live event will take place, which will pit all 100 athletes against each other in a gauntlet of 20 different obstacle courses!
        <br>
        The event will be broadcasted on Twitch for the entire duration.
        <br>
        <br>
        After each course the athletes will be given points based on their performance, and at the end of the event the three
        athletes with the most points will be given a gold, silver and bronze medal respectively along with a prize yet to be determined!
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="roadmap-section-left">
        <p>5 - Clubhouse construction<br>July - September</p>
        After the conclusion of the first ABORC event, the construction of the digital Agile Bros: Obstacle Racing Club clubhouse will commence!
        <br>
        The clubhouse will be a place for both socialization, relaxation and self-improvement, and each athlete will have access to their very own gym in the clubhouse where
        they can improve their skills in preparation for future ABORC events!
        <br>
        <br>
        Preparations for integration on the blockchain will also start at this point!

      <div class="roadmap-section-right">
        <p>6 - Agile Bros uprising<br>October - ?<br>(This will be continuously updated)</p>
        Where we go from here will be greatly influenced by the community,<br>however these things are what we will mostly focus on:
        <br>
        <br>
        - Second round of athletes will be revealed and another round of minting will begin
        <br>
        - Blockchain integration
        <br>
        - Clubhouse improvements and upgrades
